# FastSdl2Cpp

An interface library to interface in direct mode with SDL2 with C++.

## Supported Version

The supported SDL version will be the same as the latest Ubuntu LTS.

Currently, this corresponds to SDL v2.0.20.

The reason for this is simple: it eases development and permits use of a version that is stable and
widely available.
